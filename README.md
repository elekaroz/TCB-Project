Project 6a: Cluster membership. Open vs globular clusters (P. González Berdayes, E. Lekaroz Urriza, J. Prieto Polo and E. Urquijo Rodríguez)
We provide the code used to study cluster membership and obtain our results.
When executing the program, some clusters might requiere to manually input parallax values.
The program returs the plots used in the paper and number of stars in each cluster.
It can be modified to test differents clusters and filters.
All explaining is done via comments in the code.
